          <h2>Kim Ivanova</h2>

          <p class="about-p">
            I began my career with a 4+ years in UXR & UXD and another 10+ years
            of experience in retail and healthcare; client acquisition has
            taught me how to identify user's pain and find solutions that meet
            the user's need. I bring various skills from various fields, from
            NGO work in Burma to concept creation, in-game-designing,
            conceptualization, ideation and execution of products / services
            from the start to the end.

            <br />
            I believe a good user experience results from properly executing
            both design and code.

            <br />
            Therefore, I am currently learning a new skill, Java & JavaScript,
            with an accelerated program at Noroff. My experience with computer
            programming mean I can easily communicate with developers and I can
            design around the constraints. I have the demonstrated talente for
            creating beautiful designs that meets the needs of the users. <br />
            I like to take initiative, pick up new skills, and take on new
            challenges. I am an speedy learner, have worked with agile workflow,
            and approach solutions with a high degree of empathy for both the
            users and the firm.

            experiment with different AI tools and techniques.
